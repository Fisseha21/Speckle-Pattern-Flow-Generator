# Speckle-Pattern-Flow-Generator
## Description 
The goal of this repo is to generate multi-frame synthetic speckle pattern image sequences and ground-truth flows that represents the deformation field of the sequence. Each sequence has a unique speckle pattern generated by a random process which is then warped by different radomly generated deformation patterns to synthesize the full deforming sequence. This data generation can be used to supervise optical flow estimation and/or strain analysis learning processes.

## Formulation
This data generation process is inspired by [Deep DIC](https://github.com/RuYangNU/Deep-Dic-deep-learning-based-digital-image-correlation) We implemented the data generation process as described in this paper and further added the flexibility of generating multiple frames per sequence.

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
cos\theta & sin\theta \\
-sin\theta & cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\Biggl
\begin{bmatrix}
cos\theta & sin\theta \\
-sin\theta & cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\Biggl

```
## Run Code
There are four arguments to be specified by the user. `--output_path` specfies the directory where generated image sequences, ground-truth flows and flow vizualizations will be saved.  `--seq_number` and `--seq_length` represent the number of random speckle pattern sequences to generate and the number of frames per each sequence, respectively.
Lastly, the `--dimensions` argument specifies the height and width of the output speckle patterns.
```
python synthetic_data_generator.py
   --output_path=<output_path>
   --seq_number=5
   --seq_length=7
   --dimensions 512 512
```

## Output Format
The output files which includes synthetic speckle pattern image sequences, `.flo` ground truth deformation field which contains the `u` and `v` components of the flow, as well as flow visualizations, heatmap of the `u` and `v` flows.
